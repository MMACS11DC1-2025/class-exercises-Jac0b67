# Image Explorer project

# Goal: Create a program that will analyze satellite imagery and identify man-made structures in the images

# This function accepts pixel data and returns an output of true if it matches the definition of
# buildings and false if it doesn't 

# Nested loops will go over pixels from the images and calculate the feature density score for each

# Filename and score will be appended to a mater list 

# Time module will measure the time it takes to complete the loops

# Outputs the time to three decimal places

# Selection Sort algorithm function will sort the master list based on feature density score

# Binary Search algorithm function will sort through the list for a specific target score
