# README for Image Explorer

# Project Overview:
- This project will create a program that will be able to scan multiple images of satellite imagery and identify buildings and structures
- It should be able to identify buildings, roads, bridges and most man-made structures.
- From above, these features heavily contrast from natural and vegetated aras as they have very different colours
- This should make it easy for the program to clearly distinct structures from its surrondings

# Testing and Validation
- Repeatedly tested and optimized is_target_feature until it gave optimal results

# Code profiling
-

# Challenges faced
 - I took some time to wonder about what my program would do and kept on slightly changing the goals until I settled on finding the percentage
 of man-made structures in the images since I thought it would be easy to identify the objects from its surrondings.
