# ReadMe for new_project

# Approach:
- I was trying to create a snowflake fractal art generator that would allow the user
to input the number of levels and customize the colour of the pattern
-

# Debugging:
- There were some issues with indenting which led the code to not run

# Testing:
- The pattern wouldn't properly generate the way I wanted to as I was missing
